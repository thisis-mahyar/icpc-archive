## üìñ Introduction

The ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) is one of the most prestigious student programming competitions held annually in Iran. It takes place in two stages: an online qualification round followed by a regional onsite round, which is typically hosted by Sharif University of Technology. During the contest, teams compete under time constraints to solve a series of algorithmic and analytical problems.

Preparing for such competitions requires consistent effort, deep study, and strong teamwork. While many international platforms exist for practice and preparation, there has long been a lack of a localized platform offering a complete archive of past ICPC Tehran problems with an integrated judging system. Solving past regional and online ICPC problems can greatly help participants familiarize themselves with the style and structure of the contests and improve their readiness.

This platform was created to fill this gap by providing a centralized, accessible archive of Tehran ICPC regional problems, along with features such as code submission, automatic judging, detailed results, and problem analysis. This platform aims to support Iranian students and competitive programmers in their journey toward better performance and deeper understanding of algorithmic problem solving.
