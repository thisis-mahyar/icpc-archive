## The first page (Hero page or welcome page)

- Very simple
- In a view height
- At the top, there is a header
  - The left is the logo and of the site
  - The right consists of two parts: sign in, sign up
  - _You can then put "problems", "contests" part (I'm not sure)_
- The center of the page is the name of the site or the slogan
- Then, there is a short description about the site
- Also , there is a background
- _You can then put a footer (I'm not sure)_
