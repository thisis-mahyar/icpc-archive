<h1 id="problem-h-network-topology-in-hezardastan">Problem H : Network Topology in Hezardastan</h1>
<p>Hezardastan, a leading information technology group in Iran, has a huge data center containing $n$ servers and $m$ terminals (where $m \le n$). A terminal is a pair of keyboard and monitor that can be connected to a server for administrative purposes. The servers are numbered 1 through $n$ and the terminals are numbered 1 through $m$. This data center has a network topology in which not every terminal is necessarily able to connect to every server. For example, the figure below depicts 3 terminals and 6 servers where a terminal can connect to a server if a line is drawn between them.</p>

<p>A subset $S$ of the servers with size $m$ is called <em>manageable</em> if its members are allowed by the network topology to be simultaneously managed by the terminals,i.e. each terminal can be connected to a distinct server in $S$. For example, the subset ${2, 3, 6}$ in the example above is manageable as its members can be respectively managed by the terminals ${1, 2, 3}$. A subset of the servers is called <em>unmanageable</em> if it has size $m$ and is not manageable. A network topology is called <em>totally manageable</em> when it causes no unmanageable subset of servers. For example, the network topology shown in the example above is totally manageable, but if the connection link between terminal 2 and server 5 is removed, then it will not be totally manageable anymore since the subsets ${1, 5, 6}$, ${2, 5, 6} , {3, 5, 6}$, and ${4, 5, 6}$ will become unmanageable. Given a network topology for the data center, you have to find if it is totally manageable or it makes an unmanageable subset.</p>
<!-- Input -->
<p>The first line of input contains two integers $m$ and $n$ separated with a single space ($ 1 \le m \le 150, 1 \le n \le 400, m \le n$). The next $m$ lines describe the network topology by an $m \times n$ matrix. Each of these lines contains $n$ space-separated integers which are either 0 or 1. The $j$-th number (for $1 \le j \le n$) in the ($1 + i$)-th line of input (for $1 \le i \le m$) is 1 if terminal $i$ can connect to server $j$, and it is 0 otherwise.</p>
<!-- Output -->
<p>If the given network topology is totally manageable, you only have to print <code>1</code> in the first line of output. Otherwise, you should print <code>0</code> in the first line of output and an unmanageable subset of servers in the second line in the form of $m$ space-separated integers (indicating the server numbers, in any arbitrary order). If there are multiple unmanageable subsets, you can print any one of them.</p>
