<!-- Iranian Hazfi Cup <-->

<p>
    The Iranian Hazfi Cup is a football tournament organized every year in a
    knockout format; i.e. the loser of each match is immediately eliminated from
    the tournament, and the winner gets to play in the next round. Every year,
    $2 ^ k$ teams participate in this tournament (for some positive integer
    $k$). All teams start the tournament in the first round and after each
    round, half of the teams that are still in the tournament are eliminated.
    The $k$ -th round is the final round, where two teams compete for the
    championship. In total, $2 ^ k - 1$ matches are held.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>tournament bracket</em> of the Hazfi Cup is determined ahead of time
    in the drawing ceremony in the presence of special guests. It determines
    which teams are facing each other in the first round, and which other teams
    they might encounter if they advance to the next rounds. Precisely, in the
    drawing ceremony, all $2 ^ k$ teams are randomly mapped to the positions $1,
    2, \dots, 2 ^ k$ in the first round as depicted in the figure for $k = 3$

    The Iranian football federation must start organizing the Hazfi Cup 2O23. As
    many of the special guests might refuse to attend the drawing ceremony this
    year, the federation has decided to use the same tournament bracket as Hazfi
    Cup 2022. Unfortunately, last year's tournament bracket is not available,
    but all match results of last year's tournament are available in an
    arbitrary order. It can be shown that the tournament bracket can be uniquely
    determined from these match results. Your task is to recover the tournament
    bracket from the match results of Hazfi Cup 2022 in order to answer the
    following fans' common questions for this year:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>In which round two teams, A and B, may face each other?</li>
</ul>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The input starts with a line containing two space-separated integers $k$,
    the number of rounds in the tournament ($1 \le k \le 10$), and $n$, the
    number of fans' questions ($1 \le n \le 1000$). The match results of the
    Hazfi Cup 2022 come in the next $2 ^ k - 1$ lines; one line for each result.
    Each match result is of the form:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>$teamA \; g_A - g_B \; teamB$</li>
</ul>

<p>
    where $teamA$ and $teamB$ are different non-empty strings of lowercase
    English letters of length at most 100, and $g_A$ and $g_B$ denote the number
    of goals scored by $teamA$ and $teamB$, respectively ($g_A \neq g_B$). In
    the case of a draw, the winner is determined by penalty shootouts, and the
    match result is of the form:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>$teamA \; g(p_A) - g(p_B) \; teamB$</li>
</ul>

<p>
    where $g$ is the number of goals scored by each team during the main game,
    and $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the number of goals scored by $teamA$ and $teamB$
    during the penalty shootouts, respectively ($p_A \neq p_B$). The number of
    scored goals (i.e. $g_A, g_B, g, p_A$, and $p_B$) are all non-negative
    integers less than 100. Note that each line denoting a match result in the
    input contains exactly 4 space characters.
</p>
<p>
    The input ends with $n$ queries. Each query is given in a separate line
    containing two different team names delimited by a space character.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    For each query in the input, print as the answer, a single integer in a
    separate line in the output.
