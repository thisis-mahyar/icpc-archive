<!-- ICPC -->

<p>
    The Iranian ChamPions Cup (ICPC), the most prestigious football league in
    Iran, is reaching its end, and people are eagerly waiting for the finals,
    which happened to be between the two most popular Iranian teams, Persepolis
    and Esteghlal.
</p>
<p>
    The ICPC finals consist of two matches, with each team competing as the home
    team in one match. The winning team is determined by aggregate score, the
    sum of the scores of the two matches. For example, if the scores of the two
    matches are Persepolis 6-0 Esteghlal in the first match, and Esteghlal 3-1
    Persepolis in the second match, then the aggregate score will be Persepolis
    7-3 Esteghlal, meaning that Persepolis is the winner. If aggregates are
    equal, the away goals rule is used to determine the winner, in which case
    the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the match it played
    away from home. If the result is still equal, a penalty shootout is
    required.

<p>
    Hana, an avid football fan, is trying to figure out various scenarios in
    which her favorite team wins the finals. To this end, she aims to write a
    program that gets as input the number of goals in the two matches, and
    decides which team is the winner if it can be derived from the aggregate
    scores and the away goals rule, otherwise declares that the match goes to
    penalty kicks. You are going to help Hana write such a program.

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $p_1$ and
    $s_1$, where $p_1$ and $s_1$ are the number of goals scored by Persepolis
    and Esteghlal, respectively, in the first match in which Persepolis is the
    home team. The second line contains two space-separated integers $s_2$ and
    $p_2$, where $s_2$ and $p_2$ are the number of goals scored by Esteghlal and
    Persepolis, respectively, in the second match in which Esteghlal is the home
    team. All input integers are between 0 and 20, inclusively.

<!-- Output -->

<p>
    In the output, print the name of the winning team, either
    <code>Persepolis</code> or <code>Esteghlal</code>, if the winner can
    be determined by the aggregate scores and the away goals rule. Otherwise,
    print <code>Penalty</code>.
