<!-- Python Classes -->

<p>
    Mr. Programmer has been busy working on his awesome startup project lately.
    The project was coded in Python. In the past few days, he was hugely
    refactoring the source code without any testing. After all changes have been
    made, he tried to run the project, but he figured out that the code is not
    executing properly anymore due to some cyclic dependencies created in his
    source code. He struggled a little bit moving things around only to know he
    is just messing up things even further. Maybe if I move all the classes to a
    single file I'll be able to resolve the problem, he thought. But that plan
    didn't work either. With a great frustration and feeling pressure to launch
    his project as soon as possible, he has finally decided to outsource the
    task of putting things in the correct order to algorithmic specialists.
</p>
<p>
    The source code is a single Python file. It consists of a bunch of classes.
    Mr. Programmer doesn't like multiple inheritances much, so each class in his
    code has at most one super class. As he does not want to leak the content of
    the classes, he has nulled out the contents and effectively replaced them
    with the "pass" command in Python. Therefore, when a class does not have a
    superclass, it looks like below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    class &lt;CLASS_NAME&gt;:
        pass
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    When a class has a superclass, it looks like below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
    class &lt;CLASS_NAME&gt; (&lt;SUPER_CLASS_NAME&gt;):
        pass
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the above codes, <em>CLASS_NAME</em> and <em>SUPER_CLASS_NAME</em> are
    arbitrary Python identifiers. For further clarification look at the sample
    input.
</p>
<p>
    We know that the file is executable if for each class having a
    superclass, its superclass appears somewhere before the class in the file.
    Mr. Programmer doesn't like too many changes to his file, so he wants to put
    the file in the correct order with the minimum number of changes. Each
    change is counted as cutting a single class (along with its content) and
    pasting it in some other position in the file. Help Mr. Programmer find the
    minimum number of changes to file so that the file becomes executable.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The input is a python file. It consists of some python classes separated by
    a single blank line. The classes in the input are exactly in the format
    described in the problem statement. Class identifiers only consists of
    English upper or lower case letters, and their length does not exceed 10
    characters (for the sake of this problem you should not make any other
    assumptions about the identifiers). There are exactly 4 space characters
    before each "pass" command. There are at most 2,000 classes in the file. It
    is guaranteed that all superclasses are defined somewhere in the file, and
    no class is defined multiple times. Furthermore, a class is not its own
    superclass.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    Print a single integer as the minimum number of changes that have to be made
    so that the file becomes executable, or <code>-1</code> if it is not
    possible to do so.
