<!-- T-net -->

<p>
    T-net which is a new telecommunications company, plans to install its base
    stations in the city. The places where base stations must be installed have
    been already specified. T-net has two types of antennas to be used in the
    base stations: (i) antennas with transmission radius $a$, and (ii) antennas
    with transmission radius $b$. Two antennas can communicate with each other
    if and only if both are inside the coverage area of each other. Antenna with
    smaller transmission radius of course is cheaper. T-net plans to minimize
    its cost while keeping the whole network connected. Precisely, T-net plans
    to minimize its cost which is the sum of the transmission radii of all
    antennas. Interestingly, all base-station places are on a line. Help T-net
    construct a connected network with the minimum cost.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains three positive integers $n$, $a$ and
    $b$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10 ^ 5$ and $1 \\le a, b \\le 10 ^ 5$) where $n$ is the
    number of base stations, and $a$ and $b$ are radii as defined in the problem
    statement. The second line contains $n$ distinct coordinates of base
    stations on the line with respect to an origin on the line. All coordinates
    are positive integers not more than $10 ^ 5$.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    If it is possible to construct a connected network, print the minimum cost
    in the output. Otherwise, print <code>-1</code>.
