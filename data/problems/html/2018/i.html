<!-- Congestion Charging Zone -->

<p>
    Tehran municipality has set up anew charging method for the Congestion
    Charging Zone (CCZ) which controls the passage of vehicles in Tehran's
    high-congestion areas in the congestion period(CP)from 6:30 to 19:00. There
    are plate detection cameras inside or at the entrances of the CCZ recording
    vehicles seen at the CCZ. The table below summarizes the new charging
    method.
