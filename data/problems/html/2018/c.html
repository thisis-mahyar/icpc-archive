    The main movie theater of the city consists of a single auditorium with rows
    of comfortable padded seats. Surprisingly, the comfortness of seats are not
    necessarily equal. Precisely, each seat has its own comfort value which is
    anon-negative integer number. A seat is more comfortable than another seat
    if its comfort value is larger. It is only possible to enter a row from the
    left side of the auditorium. Assume the seats in a row are numbered 1 to $m$
    from left to right. When a person enters a row, he/she always sits on the
    most comfortable seat which is free and accessible to him/her. If he/she
    sits at seat $i$ he/she blocks other persons coming later to sit on seats $i
    + 1$ to $m$. If there are more than one free and accessible seat being the
    most comfortable, he/she sits on the leftmost one. The owner of the movie
    theater plans to improve the comfortness of some seats to have more
    audiences in the auditorium. Improving one unit in the comfortness of a seat
    costs some fix value. With the budget available, the owner knows the total
    improvement over all seats must not exceed a value $k$. Help the owner find
    the best way to improve the comfortness of seats by at most $k$ units in
    total to have the maximum number of audiences in the auditorium.

    The first line contains three non-negative integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1
    \le n \cdot m \le 3 \times 10 ^ 5, 0 \le k \le 10 ^ 12$) which are the
    number of rows, the number of seats in each row, and the total comfortness
    that can be added to all seats. The next $n$ lines describe the comfort
    values of seats; each line contains $m$ non-negative integers not more than
    $10 ^ 6$ denoting the comfort values of seats from left to right for a row.
