<!-- Nader Shah -->

<p>
    Nader Shah Afshar was one of the most powerful rulers in Iran. He won many
    battles, such as the battle of Herat, Mihmandust, and Kirkuk. During his
    ruling, Mashhad was Iran's capital. Each year, he planned an attack ona new
    country, and annexed it to Iran's territory. As Nader Shah's past victories
    were known to everyone, the country under attack was surrendering the battle
    without any combat. Therefore, after some years, Iran's territory was
    expanded to $n$ new countries.
</p>
<p>
    There was a connected road network between the countries. All roads were
    two-way passing. Nader Shah only attacked those countries which had at least
    one road to Iran's territory at the moment. After capturing each country,
    Nader Shah chose exactly one road between the captured country and Iran's
    territory at that moment, and put Iran flag on it at every one kilometer. In
    order to make costs as minimal as possible, he chose the shortest road as it
    needed less Iran flags (if there are more than one shortest road, he
    arbitrarily chose one of them). These roads were called Afshari roads.
    Obviously, by choosing the roads this way, there are exactly $k - 1$ Afshari
    roads when Iran's territory consists of $k$ countries.
</p>
<p>
    Several years later, we have received a map of Iran's territory at the end
    of Nader Shah's life. The map has all the road network on it with their
    lengths in kilometers. Afshari roads are marked in the map. There are $n$
    countries on the map, $m$ roads connecting them, and $n - 1$ of those roads
    marked as Afshari. Each country is marked by a distinct number $1 \le x \le
    n$. We do not distinguish between the numbers and the countries.
</p>
<p>
    Given the map described above, we want to know the possible country
    corresponding to Iran and the order by which Nader Shah captured countries.
    One possible answer can be shown as $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ where $a_1$
    corresponds to Iran, $a_2$ is the first country that Nader Shah captured,
    $a_3$ is the second country he captured, and so on. We want to know the
    lexicographically minimum possible answer. Array $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is
    lexicographically smaller than $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ if and only if there
    exists a number $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) that $(x_1 = y_1) \wedge (x_2 = y_2)
    \wedge \dots \wedge (x_{i - 1} = y_{i - 1})$ and $x_i \le y_i$.

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($ 1 \le n \le
    1,000, n - 1 \le m \le 5,000$) where $n$ and $m$ are the number of countries
    and the number of roads in the map (the road network), respectively. The
    next $m$ lines describe the road network; each line contains four integers
    $u$, $v$ , $w$ and $r$ ($1 \le u, v \le n, 1 \le w \le 10 ^ 6$, and $r \in
    {0, 1}$) which indicate there is a road between $u$ and $v$ with the length
    of $w$ kilometers, and $r$ denotes whether the road is Afshari or not. The
    road is Afshari if and only if $r = 1$. There is at most one road between
    two countries. It is guaranteed that there are exactly $n - 1$ Afshari roads
    in the road network, and all $n$ countries are connected through these $n -
    1$ roads.
