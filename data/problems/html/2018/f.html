<!-- Imputation -->

<p>
    Leila is a Bioinformatician, interested in studying Bacterial evolution. In
    one experiment on a special type of Bacteria, she started from a single
    bacterium, put it on a plate, and monitored the bacterial division, until
    she obtained a population of $k$ bacteria. During the process, she carefully
    reported the evolutionary relations between bacteria. Precisely, for each
    bacterium, she reported its parent bacterium.
</p>
<p>
    In the next step, she extracted DNA sequences of $k$ bacteria in the final
    population, by NGS technology. Each DNA sequence is represented as a string
    of length $m$ from the alphabet set ${A, T, C, G}$.
</p>
<p>
    The NGS technology has a drawback: it produces a lot of missing values. So,
    there are a lot of unknown characters indicated by '?' in the extracted
    sequences. Considering the evolutionary relationship between bacteria, Leila
    wants to impute the missing values. Among all possible imputations, she
    wants to find the minimum cost imputation from an evolutionary perspective.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is defined as follows. A rooted tree $T$ is given, and for each
    leaf $v$ of $T$, a string $b_v$ of length $m$ from the character set ${A, T,
    C, G, ?}$ is given. A transition cost matrix $\Delta$ is also given, where
    $\Delta (x, y)$ ($x, y \in {A, T, C, G}$) represents the cost of a
    transition from an $x$ character to a $y$ character, from a parent to its
    child.
</p>
<p>
    A feasible imputation, assigns a string $s_u$ of length $m$ from the
    character set ${A, T, C, G}$ to each vertex $u$, where for each leaf $v$ of
    $T$, $s_v$ is equal to $b_v$ except for '?' characters in $b_v$. The
    evolutionary cost of an imputation is defined as the sum of evolutionary
    costs of all edges. The evolutionary cost of an edge between parent $u$ and
    child $w$, is defined as $\sum _ {i = 1} ^ m \Delta (s_u [i], s_w [i])$,
    where $s_u [i]$ is the $i$-th character of $s_u$.
</p>
<p>
    Leila wants to find a feasible imputation for $T$, which has the minimum
    evolutionary cost among all feasible imputations. The tree $T$, transition
    cost matrix $\Delta$, and a string $b_v$ for each leaf $v$ are given. You
    should write a program to compute the minimum evolutionary cost of feasible
    imputations.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10,000$)
    denoting the number of vertices of $T$. The vertices of $T$ are numbered
    from 1 to $n$. The root of the tree is numbered 1. The root is never
    considered as a leaf, even if it has only one child. The next $n - 1$ lines
    describe the edges of $T$; each line contains two endpoints of an edge
    separated by spaces. In the next four lines, the evolutionary cost matrix
    $\Delta$ is given; each line is for one row of $\Delta$. Rows (corresponding
    to a parent) and columns (corresponding to a child) of $\Delta$ are ordered
    to respectively represent characters $A$, $T$, $C$ and $G$. All entries of
    $\Delta$ are non-negative integers not more than $10 ^ 6$. The next line
    just contains $k$, the number of leaves. Finally, each leaf $v$ (its number)
    and its $b_v$ which is a string of size $m$ ($1 \le m \le 200$) appear in
    one line.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In one line, print the minimum evolutionary cost of feasible imputations.
