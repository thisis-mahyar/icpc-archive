<!-- Border Wall -->

<p>
    Through one of the most controversial presidential elections in the world,
    Mr. Trunk was finally elected as the president of Demoland. During his long
    presidential campaign, Mr. Trunk made a series of strange promises, one of
    which was to build a wall along the border of Demoland with its neighboring
    country, Indoland.

<p>
    Now, months after his election, Mr. Trunk has started thinking on how to
    really build the wall. To keep things simple, he has decided to build the
    wall along a straight line. However, there are still several difficulties.
    The main issue is that the houses owned by the citizens of these two
    neighboring countries are so mixed that it is almost impossible to separate
    them bya straight wall Wherever the wallis built, some houses must be
    evacuated and their residents must be moved to the other side of the wall in
    order to keep all citizens of each county on one side of the wall. The
    second issue is that the wall itself has some width, meaning that all houses
    intersected by the wall must be destructed. Of course, evacuating or
    destructing each house has a cost, and if the total number of such houses is
    high, it would raise a vigorous public protest. To make his final decision,
    Mr. Trunk is looking for a keen advisor to tell him how many houses must be
    evacuated/destructed at the minimum in order to build a straight border wall
    of a desired width.

    Being active in ACM ICPC, you have been selected as an advisor to Mr.
    President. The locations of the houses owned by the citizens of each country
    is given to you as a set of points in the plane. The desired width of the
    border wall is also given to you by the president. Your task is to compute
    the minimum number of points (houses) that must be removed (destructed or
    evacuated) so that the remaining point sets can be separated by a wall of
    the given width. Two point sets are called separated by a wall if (i) no two
    points from different sets lie in the same side of the wall, and (ii) none
    of the points intersects the wall except on its boundary lines.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    There are multiple test cases in the input. The first line of each test case
    contains three positive integers $n$, $k$, $d$, where $n$ and $k$ indicate
    the number of houses owned by the citizens of Demoland and Indoland,
    respectively, and $d$ indicates the width of the border wall ($1 \\le n, k
    \\le 100$) and ($0 \\le d &lt; 1,000$). The next $n$ lines, each contains two
    integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \\le x, y \\le 10,000$), where ($x, y$) represents
    the location of a house owned by a citizen of Demoland. Analogously, the
    next $k$ lines represent the location of the houses owned by the citizens
    ofIndoland. Note that no two houses are located in the same position. The
    input terminates with a line containing <code>0 0 0</code> which should not
    be processed.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    For each testcase, output a line containing the minimum number of the points
    that must be removed to construct the wall. Note that all houses from a
    country may be destructed/evacuated in the optimal solution.
