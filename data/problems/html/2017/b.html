<!-- Bank Card Verifier -->

<p>
    Cafe Bazaar, the famous Iranian android market, is looking for creative
    software developers. A group of applicants are attending an interview, and
    the company wants to select the fastest developer who can code simple rules
    accurately. As a test, all applicants should quickly develop a bank card
    verifier that determines whether a payment card number is valid or not.
</p>
<p>
    All payment card numbers are 16 digits long. The leftmost 6 digits represent
    a unique identification number for the bank who has issued the card. The
    next 2 digits determine the type of the card (e.g. debit, credit, gift).
    Digits 9 to 15 are the serial number of the card, and the last digit is used
    as a control digit to verify whether the card number is valid. Hence, if
    somebody enters the card number incorrectly, there is a high chance that a
    payment software can easily determine it.
</p>
<p>
    For a valid card number, the last digit is selected in such a way that the
    following algorithm passes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Label all digits from left to right by 1 to 16.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Multiply each odd-labeled digit by 2.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If the result for any digit is greater than 9, subtract 9 from it.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Sum the results of the previous step, and add to it the sum of all
            even-labeled digits.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If the result is a multiple of 10, the card number is valid;
            otherwise, it is invalid.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Your task is to read several card numbers from the input, and determine
    whether each one is a valid card number or not.
</p>

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    There are multiple test cases in the input. Each testis given in one line
    consisting of four space-separated 4-digit strings. The leftmost digit of
    the given card number is guaranteed to be non-zero. The input terminates
    with a line containing <code>0000 0000 0000 0000</code> that should not be
    processed.
</p>

<!-- Output -->

<p>
    For each testcase, output a line containing <code>Yes</code> or
    <code>No</code> depending on whether the card number is valid or not,
    respectively.
</p>
