<!-- New Country Division -->

<p>
    Tehran province is decided to be divided into two provinces: Alborz and New
    Tehran. There are lots of cities in the old Tehran province that should be
    distributed between these two new provinces. The criteria for distribution
    is the safety of inter-province transportation.
</p>
<p>
    Amir is given the map of old Tehran province, including cities and roads and
    a safety measure foreach road. He is supposed to decide for each city to be
    in either New Tehran or Alborz province. There are two special cities,
    Tehran and Karaj that should be in New Tehran and Alborz provinces,
    respectively. Note that it is possible that a city in a province will not be
    reachable by another city in the same province.
</p>
<p>
    Amir needs to divide the cities in the safest possible manner. The safety of
    a province division is calculated using a drone. The drone flies between two
    provinces and crosses all bidirectional roads connecting two cities in
    different provinces exactly once. Each time it passes over a road, the drone
    calculates the safety of that road and updates the overall safety of the
    roads it has passed so far. The safety of a road is calculated using a
    sensor that stores it as a 60-bit binary number. The drone also stores the
    overall safety in a 60-bit binary number. After passing a road with safety
    $x_60 x_59 \\dots x_1$, the $i$-th bit of the overall safety is flipped if
    $x_i$ equals 1 and is left untouched otherwise. The safety of the province
    division is the overall safety after the drone finishes its journey. Note
    that initially the overall safety is zero, so if there is no road between
    two provinces the overall safety does not change during drone's journey
    which means the safety of that province division is zero.
</p>
<p>
    There are $n$ cities in the old Tehran numbered from 1 to $n$. Tehran is
    city number 1 and Karaj is city number $n$. Your task is to help Amir by
    writing a program that finds a division of cities with the maximum overall
    safety.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    There are multiple test cases in the input. The first line of each test case
    contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$, and $1 \\le m \\le \\frac
    {n (n - 1)} 2$), which indicate the number of cites and the total number of
    roads, respectively. The next $m$ lines, each contain three positive
    integers $u$, $v$ and $r$ ($1 \\le u, v \\le n, u \\ne v$, and $0 \\le r \\le 2 ^
    60$) which indicate that there is a road between cities $u$ and $v$ with
    safety $r$ (assume that the safety of all roads has been already calculated
    by the drone's sensor). It is guaranteed that there is at most one road
    between each pair of cities. Input terminates with a line containing <code>0
    0</code>which should not be processed.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    For each test case, output a line containing the overall safety of the
    division which maximizes it.
