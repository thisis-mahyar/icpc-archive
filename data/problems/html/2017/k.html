<!-- Mars -->

<p>
    A new form of life is recently discovered on Mars. Every alien has a DNA,
    that is a string with an alphabet of only two, rather than four, letters.
    Hence, we can show the DNA ofa Mars alien by a binary string. Let $s$ be
    an alien DNA of length $n$. There are $q$ regions in the DNA specified as
    <em>genes</em>. A gene located at $[a, b]$ is a substring of the DNA,
    containing characters from position $a$ to position $b$, inclusive ($1 \le a
    \le b \le n$). A gene might overlap with or be inside the other genes.
</p>
<p>
    During the life of a Mars alien, each gene is copied billions of times: a
    protein binds to the start of the gene, and copies the gene from start to
    the end. But this process is not error-free, and might produce mutations. In
    each mutation, a <code>0</code> in the gene is copied as <code>1</code>, or
    vice versa. A mutated copy does not match the gene, but might match
    a(possibly overlapping) substring in another position of the DNA. For
    instance, assume that $s = 001011111$ and a gene is located at $[3, 6]$.
    Hence, the gene string is 1011. A copy of this gene can be 1111, which is
    mutated at the second letter. Although 1111 does not match the original $[3,
    6]$ substring in the DNA, it matches $[5, 8]$. A mutated copy of a gene is
    called <em>degenerate</em> if it does not appear in any place of the whole
    DNA. Hence, 10l0, a copy of the same gene having one mutation at the fourth
    letter, is degenerate, but 1111 is not.
</p>
<p>
    Your task is to find, for each gene, the minimum number of mutations that
    can result in a degenerate copy of that gene.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    There are multiple test cases in the input. The first line of each test case
    contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 10,000$ and $1 \le q \le
    1000$). The next line contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$. Each of
    the next $q$ lines contains the location $[a, b]$ of a gene, in the form of
    two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a \le b \le n$). The input
    terminates with a line containing <code>0 0</code> that should not be
    processed.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    For each gene, print the minimum number of mutations that can result ina
    degenerate copy. If no set of mutations applied on a gene can result in a
    degenerate copy, print <code>Impossible</code> instead.
