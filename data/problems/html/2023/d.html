<!-- Cup of Tea -->

<p>
    Abolf lives in Aboland, a country consisting of $n$ cities and $n - 1$
    two-way roads. In Aboland, one can travel from any city to any other city
    using these roads. Aboland's cities are numbered from 1 to $n$.
</p>
<p>
    Abolbucks is a multinational chain of teahouses which serves the best tea in
    the world. When Abolf enters a city with an Abolbucks branch, he drinks a
    cup of tea and instantly reaches $k$ units of happiness. However, each time
    Abolf travels through the $i ^ {th}$ road, he must pay $c_i$ coins as toll
    which causes him to lose $c_i$ units of happiness.
</p>
<p>
    Abolf currently resides in city 1 and wants to plan his summer trip. If at
    any point during his trip Abolf's happiness drops below zero, he would stop
    his trip immediately. For each city $t$ (for $2 \le t \le n$), Abolf wants
    to know what is the minimum amount of coins he should pay to reach city $t$
    while making sure that his happiness remains non-negative at all time,
    including at the destination.
</p>
<p>
    He has asked you to find this amount for each city except for his home city.
    Note that each destination should be considered separately. Also, he may
    visit a city multiple times during his trip.
</p>

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 3
    \cdot 10 ^ 5, 1 \le k \le 10 ^ 9$), the number of cities in Aboland and
    Abolf's happiness after he drinks a cup of tea, respectively. Each of the
    next $n - 1$ lines contains three space-separated integers $v_i$, $u_i$, and
    $c_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n, 1 \le c_i \le 10 ^ 9, u_i \neq v_i$)
    indicating that the $i ^ {th}$ road connects city $u_i$ and city $v_i$, and
    Abolf should pay $c_i$ coins each time he travels through this road. The
    last line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a _ {
    i } \le 1$). If $a_i = 1$, there is an Abolbucks branch in city $i$. It is
    guaranteed that $a_1 = 1$.
</p>

<!-- Output -->

<p>
    In the only line of the output, you should print $n - 1$ integers. The $i ^
    {th}$ number should be the minimum amount of coins it takes for Abolf to
    reach city $i + 1$ from city 1. If there is no way to reach city $i + 1$
    such that Abolf's happiness remains non-negative at all time, print $-1$ for
    that city.
