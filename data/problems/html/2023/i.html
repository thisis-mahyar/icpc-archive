<!-- Pistons -->

<p>
    Maryam, a famous mathematician, recently has bought an old vintage car. This
    car uses a combustion engine to generate the power needed to move the car.
    Inside the engine, there are $n$ cylinders of length $m$ and inside each
    cylinder, there is a piston constantly moving up and down. All pistons move
    independently and at the same speed. At any given time, the position of a
    piston inside a cylinder can be shown with an integer from O to $m$, which
    also describes the area of the cylinder occupied by the piston. A piston
    instantly changes its direction when it reaches the top (position $m$) or
    bottom (position O) of its cylinder.

    Maryam managed to determine the position and direction of all the pistons at
    a specific time. Now she is curious about the maximum total area occupied by
    all the pistons. Help Maryam find out this value.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10 ^
    5, 1 \\le m \\le 10 ^ 6$), describing the number of pistons and the length of
    cylinders, respectively. Each of the next $n$ lines describe the position
    and direction of a single piston. The ($i + 1$) $^ {th}$ line of the input
    contains an integer $p_i$ ($0 \\le p_i \\le m$), and a character $d_i$ ($d_i
    \\in$ <code>{U, D}</code>), the initial position of the $i ^ {th}$ piston and
    its direction (Up or Down), respectively.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    Print a single integer, the maximum total area occupied by all the pistons.
