<h1 id="problem-e-largest-triangle">Problem E: Largest Triangle</h1>
<p>A "terrain" is an $x$-monotone polygon defined by the points $p_1, \dots, p_n$ where each point $p_i$ has coordinates ($x_i, y_i$), and the following three conditions hold:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$y_1 = y_n = 0$</li>
    <li>$y_i &gt; 0$ for $1 &lt; i &lt; n$</li>
    <li>$x<em>i &lt; x</em>{i + 1}$ for $1\le i &lt; n$</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a terrain defined by the points $p_1, \dots, p_n$, find the largest triangle that fits entirely within the terrain, and one of its three vertices is positioned at one of the terrain points $p<em>2$ through $p</em>{n - 1}$.</p>
<!-- Input -->
<p>The first line of input contains an integer $n$, representing the number of points in the terrain ($3 \le n \le 10 ^ 5$). The $i ^ {th}$ line in the following $n$ lines consists of two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i}$, representing the point $p_i$ of the terrain ($0 \le x_i, y_i \le 10 ^ 9$).</p>
<!-- Output -->
<p>Print the area of the largest triangle contained within the terrain. Your output will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error is at most $10 ^ {-6}$.</p>
