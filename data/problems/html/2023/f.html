<!-- Micromasters Certificates -->

<p>
    The Department of Computer Engineering has provided several micromasters,
    each containing a curriculum. If a student successfully completes all the
    courses of a micromaster, he will receive the certificate of that
    micromaster. A course may be included in the curriculum of several
    micromasters. Soroush, who only thinks about getting a certificate and
    doesn't care about the type of certificate, wants to get 3 micromasters
    certificates by taking the minimum possible number of courses. The
    micromasters curriculums are posted on the bulletin board. Help Soroush
    reach his goal according to the micromasters curriculums.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The input represents a bulletin board. The board consists of at most 400
    rows and 400 columns. Each micromasters curriculum is encapsulated in a
    rectangular box. The boundaries of the bulletin board and the curriculum
    boxes are represented by characters "+", "-", and "|" for corners,
    horizontal sides, and vertical sides, respectively. The curriculum boxes are
    disjoint (with no characters in common) and each has its own boundary. Each
    line inside a curriculum box contains at most one course name. Course names
    consist of alphanumeric and space characters. Course names are not
    case-sensitive, and spaces do not matter in them. For example, <code>General
    math1</code>and<code>generalMath 1</code> are the same. There are at most 5O
    curriculum boxes and each box contains at most 3O courses. It is guaranteed
    that there are at least 3 boxes on the board and there is at least 1 course
    in each box.
