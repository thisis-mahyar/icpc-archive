<!-- Necklace Construction -->

<p>
    Yalda wants to give a brilliant gift to Bahar for her birthday. She has
    drawn the sketch ofa necklace consisting of $n$ beads of different colors on
    paper. The necklace is illustrated by a string of length $n$ which is made
    up of lowercase English letters that indicate the colors of the beads. Each
    of the 26 English letters represents a distinct color. Yalda is going to
    make the necklace using the infinite number of beads in different colors she
    has. However, as Bahar's birthday is approaching, she has a little time and
    wants to make the necklace in the fewest steps possible. Yalda has two empty
    necklaces initially. One of the necklaces is going to be the final gift, and
    the other one is a buffer necklace that helps her during the construction.
    At each step she can do one of the followings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add a bead of the desired color at an arbitrary place in the buffer
            necklace,
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Remove a bead at an arbitrary place from the buffer necklace,
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Substitute a bead of the buffer necklace with a bead of the desired
            color, or
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Append a string of beads to the end of the main necklace, copying
            the buffer necklace. The added string will be exactly the same as
            the buffer necklace. However, the order of the beads in the buffer
            necklace wil get reversed during the copying procedure (for example,
            if the main necklace equals <code>pq</code> and the buffer necklace
            equals <code>abc</code> before this procedure, the main necklace
            becomes <code>pqabc</code> and the buffer necklaces becomes <code>cba</code>
            after the procedure).
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Yalda would really appreciate it if you could tell her the minimum number of
    steps required for making the necklace.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The only line of the input consists of a non-empty string of lowercase
    English letters with at most 300 letters.<br>The string indicates the sketch
    of the desired necklace.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In the only line of output, print a single number indicating the minimum
    number of steps that are required to make the necklace.
