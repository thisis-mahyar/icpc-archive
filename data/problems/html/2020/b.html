<!-- Statistics -->

<p>
    Coronavirus cases are now rising very fast in Neverland. The rise is mainly
    caused by a new variant of the virus which is spreading more rapidly than
    the original version. People are frustrated by seeing another pick n the
    statistics, while at the same time, there is no clear estimate on when
    vaccination will be available in the country.
</p>
<p>
    Although the new variant of coronavirus is not believed to be more deadly,
    the rise in the new case statistics has made people panicked and afraid.
    Therefore, the government of Neverland has decided to manipulate the new
    case statistics slightly to reduce people's anxiety. The goal of the
    manipulation is to show that the new cases are not rising in the coming few
    days. More precisely, the number of new cases announced in each of the
    coming days must be equal or lower than the number announced in its
    preceding day. Due to investigations, the only way to change the statistics
    is to throw away some test results. Therefore, the announced numbers must be
    always less than or equal to the real numbers.
</p>
<p>
    As the manipulation is not free, the government is going to hire a computer
    scientist to calculate the minimum total amount by which the real numbers
    must be changed in order to achieve the above goal. Due to your experience
    in the ICPC programming contests, the government has selected you for this
    critical mission.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input consists of $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10000$), the
    number of the coming days. Each of the next $n$ lines contains an integer
    $p_i$ ($0 \le p_i \le 1000$), indicating the real number of new cases at the
    $i$-th day.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In the output, print the minimum total amount by which the real numbers must
    be changed in order to have new cases not to be rising in the coming days.
