<!-- Science Fiction -->

<p>
    Arts and literature have always been influenced by science. This appears,
    for example, in Christopher Nolan movies. But, there is a scientist who is
    doing his research on a hypothesis based on fictional novels.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Khosro, a theoretical physicist, does research on parallel worlds with
    high-dimensions, inspired by Isaac Asimov's novels. During his research, he
    needs a method of sorting in his imaginary high-dimension network of
    planets. In Dr. Khosro's imaginary $n$-dimensional world, there are $2 ^ n$
    planets and a wormhole network connecting them. The network is like an
    $n$-dimensional hypercube. The planets are numbered with non-negative
    integers less than $2 ^ n$, and there is a wormhole from planet $a$ to
    planet $b$ if and only if the $n$-bit binary representations of $a$ and $b$
    differ in exactly one bit-position. In Dr. Khosro's model, there is a number
    written on each planet and we can swap the numbers of two planets only if
    there is a direct wormhole between them. You are given the numbers written
    on each planet, construct a valid sequence of swaps that makes the numbers
    sequence sorted from smallest to largest. Formally, if the number written on
    the planet number $i$ ($0 \le i \le 2 ^ n$) is denoted by $a_i$, you have to
    construct a sequence of valid pairwise swaps that makes the sequence $a =
    \langle a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{2 ^ n - 1} \rangle$ in increasing order.

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    The first line of input consists of $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10$), the dimension of
    Dr. Khosro's imaginary world. The next line contains $2 ^ n$ <strong>distinct</strong>
    integers, indicating $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{2 ^ n - 1}$ ($0 \le a_i \le
    10 ^ 6$).
</p>
<!-- Output -->

<p>
    Print the numbers of your swaps in the first line. Your answer will be
    considered correct if this number is non-negative and less than 12000. Then
    in the following lines, print the sequence of swaps. In your solution, every
    swap must be between two planets with a direct wormhole between them.
