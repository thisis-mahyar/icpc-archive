<!-- McFly -->

<p>
    A fly named McFly is going to a party tonight. Unfortunately for him, it's a
    party for humans, not flies.
</p>
<p>
    There is going to be a $10 ^ 9$ meter long table at the party, where humans
    put down their cookies for a while before they pick them up again later.
    That's when McFly can buzz in and taste the cookie while the human is
    leaving his/her cookie unattended. Tasting cookies is McFly's favorite thing
    to do. He doesn't want to eat them, he just wants to <em>enjoy</em> tasting
    as many cookies as possible. He'll enjoy tasting a cookie if it is different
    from the previous cookie he tasted, or if it is the first cookie he tastes
    at the party. That means he can enjoy tasting the same cookie multiple
    times, as long as he tastes at least one other cookie between every two
    tastings of the same cookie.
</p>
<p>
    But McFly is prepared. He went to see a fortune-teller to know what is going
    to happen at the party. The fortune-teller told him about $n$ cookies, which
    are going to be put down on the table. The $i$-th cookie is going to be at
    position $x_i$ (i.e. $x_i$ meters from start of the table), from time $s_i$
    to $f_i$ (Times are measured in seconds, from the start of the party). It is
    guaranteed that no two cookies will be at the same position, at the same
    time; i.e., for every $i$ and $j$ where $i \neq j$ and $x_i = x_j$, either
    $f_i \le s_j$ or $f_j \le s_i$. More specifically, the table can be
    considered as a horizontal line on which McFly and the cookies are seen as
    points. McFly can be present at any position before the start of the party.
    At any time afterward, he can fly at the speed of1 meter per second along
    with the table, or stay in place. McFly can taste cookie $i$ if he is at
    position $x_i$ at some time $t$ where $s_i \le t \le f_i$ Tasting cookies
    take no time.

<p>
    Help McFly to enjoy as many tastes as possible.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100000$).
    The $i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $x_i, s_i$ and
    $f_i$ ($0 \le x_i \le 10 ^ 9, 0 \le s_i \le f_i \le 10 ^ 9$). The total
    time of cookies being on the table is at most $10 ^ 5$ ($\sum _ {i = 1}
    ^ {n} f_i - s_i \le 10 ^ 5$).
