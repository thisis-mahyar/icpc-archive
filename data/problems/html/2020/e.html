<!-- Social Distancing -->

<p>
    Leila is a surgeon in a high-quality hospital. To reach the operating room,
    she has to pass through a waiting saloon, where some patients with
    Coronavirus symptoms are waiting to get tested. To avoid the infection,
    Leila wants to pass through the saloon in such a way that she keeps the
    maximum distance from the patients. Your task is to help her find the
    maximum possible distance from any patient while passing through the waiting
    saloon. You are given the map of the saloon as a matrix, in which the
    locations of the patients and the free seats (where she can not pass
    through!) are marked. The distance of two cells ($x_1, y_1$) and ($x_2,
    y_2$) in the matrix is defined as max($| x_1 - x_2 |, | y_1 - y_2 |$). Seats
    do not block corona from spreading. Thus, in the definition of the distance
    between two cells, we do not consider the places of the seats. In each step,
    Leila can go from one cell in the matrix to one of its four neighbors: up,
    down, right, and left in the saloon, if no seats and patients are there.

<!-- Input -->

<p>
    The first line of the input consists of two integers $m$ ($1 \le m \le 500$)
    and $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) separated by a space, which is the number of
    rows and the number of columns, respectively. Then, the map of the waiting
    saloon is given in $m$ following lines; each line represents a row of the
    matrix and contains $n$ characters, <code>*</code> is for a patient,
    <code>#</code> for an empty seat, and <code>.</code> for free space where
    Leila can walk through. The starting point of Leila is represented by an
    <code>S</code> character, and the endpoint of her path is represented by an
    <code>E</code> character in the matrix. Note that Leila cannot go out of the
    saloon (which is represented as the matrix) in her path.

<!-- Output -->

<p>
    Print the maximum possible distance which Leila can maintain from the
    patients in her path. If it is not possible for Leila to reach the operating
    room at all, print a <code>-1</code> in the output. Otherwise, if no patient
    is present in the saloon, print<code>safe</code> in the output.
