<h1 id="problem-m-stabbing-number">Problem M : Stabbing Number</h1>
<p>A histogram is a simple rectilinear polygon $H$ (i.e. the interior angle at each vertex is either $90 ^ \circ$ or $270 ^ \circ$) that has a horizontal edge seeing every point $q$ inside (i.e. the interior or the boundary of) $H$. Here, we say that an edge sees a point $q \in H$ if there is a vertical segment $s$ connecting $e$ to $q$ that is lying inside $H$.</p>
<p>Let $H$ be a histogram with $n$ vertices, and consider a decomposition $R$ of $H$ into rectangles whose sides are vertical or horizontal. The vertices of the rectangles need not all be vertices of $H$: it is allowed to introduce additional vertices, on the boundary of $H$ and/or in its interior. The stabbing number of a horizontal or vertical segment $s$ inside $H$ with respect to such a decomposition $R$ is the number of rectangles from $R$ whose interior (not just their boundaries) are intersected by $s$. The stabbing number of $R$ is the maximum stabbing number of any horizontal or vertical segment $s$ that lies inside $H$. The goal is to compute a decomposition $R$ with the minimum stabbing number.</p>
<!-- Input -->
<p>The first line of the input contains two positive integers $m$ and $n$ ($1 \le m, n \le 50$) denoting the number of rows and the number of columns of the table illustrating the histogram, respectively. The next $m$ lines, each contains exactly $n$ characters. <code>*</code>s denote the boundary of the histogram. The rest is filled with dots (<code>.</code>). Each edge of the histogram contains at least three<code>*</code>s. You can assume the given histogram has at least four and at most 16 edges, and edges do not overlap, intersect or touch each other; i.e. each <code>*</code> is adjacent to exactly two other <code>*</code> characters.</p>
<!-- Output -->
<p>Print the stabbing number of the given histogram in one line.</p>
