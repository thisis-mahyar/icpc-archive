<!-- Gift Puzzle -->

<p>
    Peyman's birthday party is being held. Keivan, his old friend, has bought a
    puzzle as a birthday gift. The puzzle consists of a flat rectangular board
    with a length of $l$ and a width of $w$, and a thread. The board has $n$
    horizontal rails of length $l$ placed at different distances from the top
    horizontal side. On each rail, there is one obstacle which can <em>slide
    freely</em> on the rail. An example of the board is depicted in the figure.
    The rails are illustrated by dotted lines, and the obstacles are illustrated
    by thick segments.

<p>
    In order to solve the puzzle, one must connect the top-left corner of the
    board to the bottom-right corner using the supplied thread. The thread must
    be inside the board and cannot pass through obstacles. In the figure, one
    possible way to do the puzzle is shown. Since Keivan believes in Peyman's
    ability to solve hard puzzles, he wants to give Peyman the shortest thread
    while it is still possible to connect the two corners. So, kindly help
    Keivan to find the desired length of the thread.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains three integers $l$, $w$ ($2 \le l, w
    \le 10 ^ 9$), the length and the width of the board, and $n$ ($1 \le n \le
    min(100000, w - 1)$), the number of the rails. Each of the next $n$ lines
    contains two integers $y_i$ ($1 \le y_i \le w - 1$), indicating the distance
    between the $i$-th rail and the top horizontal side, and $l_i$ ($1 \le l_i
    \le l - 1$), length of the obstacle on the $i$-th rail. Note that all
    $y_i$'s are distinct. You may assume that all obstacles and the thread have
    a width of zero.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In the only line of the output, print the minimum $t$ for which it is
    possible to configure obstacles such that the top-left corner can be
    connected to the bottom-left corner using a thread of length $t$ while
    avoiding obstacles. Your answer is considered to be correct if it has a
    relative error of at most $10 ^ {-9}$.
