<!-- Greedy Termite -->

<p>
    There are $n$ wooden rods vertically placed over a horizontal line. The rods
    are numbered 1 through $n$ from left to right. Each rod $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le
    n$) is placed at position $x_i$ and has a height $h_i$.
</p>

<p>
    A termite wants to eat all the rods one by one. It starts eating from an
    arbitrary rod $s$ ($ 1 \\le s \\le n$). Then, after eating a rod $i$, the
    termite selects the next rod to eat based on the following method. Among the
    remaining rods $j$, the one with maximum $h_j - | x_i - x_j |$ is selected.
    If there are ties, the one with minimum $| x_i - x_j |$ is selected. If
    there are still ties, the left-most rod is selected.
</p>
<p>
    Your task is to calculate the total (horizontal) distance traveled by the
    termite to eat all the rods.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$, the
    number of rods, and $s$, the starting rod number ($1 \\le s \\le n \\le
    100000$). The rods are described in the next $n$ lines. On the line $1 + i$
    ($1 \\le i \\le n$), the $i$-th rod is specified with two space-separated
    integers $x_i$ ($| x_i | \\le 10 ^ 9$) and $h_i$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le 10 ^ 9$).
    Additionally, for each $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n - 1$), $x_i \\le x_{i +
    1}$.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    You should print a single integer denoting the total distance traveled by
    the termite.
