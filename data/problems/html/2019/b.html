<!-- Gold Rush -->

<p>
    Again, Neverland has experienced a very bad economic condition over the past
    few months. The value of Oshloob, the national currency of Neverland,
    changes against one unit of gold very rapidly. People in Neverland, all
    wondering about their savings, are trying to exchange their savings with
    gold coins.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Predictman who is a data scientist, has obtained a prediction of the
    price (in Oshloobs)of a gold coin for the next $n$ days based on the
    existing data over the past 40 years. He believes his prediction, and now he
    wants to increase his savings based on it. He was wondering how many savings
    he has at the end of the $n$-th day assuming that he has $c$ Oshloobs at the
    beginning of the first day. Since Dr. Predictman is not a programmer, he
    asks you to help to find his answer.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains two integers $c$ ($0 \\le c \\le 3000$),
    Dr. Predictman's initial savings in Oshloobs, and $n$ ($0 \\le n \\le 30$),
    the period of his prediction. Each of the next following $n$ lines contains
    an integer $p_i$ ($1000 \\le p_i \\le 2000$) denoting the price of a gold coin
    at day $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) in Oshloobs.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    The output contains just an integer, which indicates the maximum savings he
    can obtain at the end of the $n$-th day assuming that Dr. Predictman
    exchanges all his remaining gold coins (if there is any) to Oshloobs at the
    end of the $n$-th day.
