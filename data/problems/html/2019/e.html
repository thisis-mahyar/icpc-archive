<!-- The Big Surprise -->

<p>
    "A big surprise is coming on the next Thursday!", the young mayor of
    TetrisCity announced in the social media. TetrisCity is the most populous
    and modern city in Neverland constructed on a flat area with endless
    clusters of high-rise buildings packed so closely together that they
    resemble a game of Tetris. Buildings look like axis-parallel boxes
    constructed on the ground and they are disjoint (they do not even touch each
    other).
</p>
<p>
    The big surprise announced by the mayor is going to be a special delivery
    service using drones. The drones used in this service are a generation of
    quadcopters which can physically move only in one of $x$, $y$ and $z$
    directions. So, the distance traveled by a drone is the sum of distances
    traveled by it in each axis. The young mayor now has ordered to make the
    drones smart by equipping them with a software that computes the shortest
    path from any source to any destination avoiding the buildings. Your job is
    to develop this software.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($0 \le n \le 100$),
    specifying the number of buildings in the TetrisCity. Each of the next $n$
    lines contains 5 space-separated integers $x$, $y$, $x ^ \prime$, $y ^
    \prime$ and $h$ specifying a building: the coordinates ($x, y $) and ($x ^
    \prime, y ^ \prime$) respectively specify the west-south corner and the
    east-north corner of the building, and $h$ determines its height. It is
    guaranteed that the volume of the building is not zero. The source and
    destination appear at the end of the input in two separated lines; each
    containing $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates. All numbers in the input are
    non-negative integers being at most 10000. It is guaranteed that the source
    and destination are outside the buildings (they can be on the boundary of
    buildings). The shortest path can touch buildings and it is assumed that a
    drone looks like a point.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In the output, print the length of the shortest path from the source to the
    destination avoiding the buildings.
