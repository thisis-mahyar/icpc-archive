<!-- Plan B -->

<p>
    In CrisisLand, every now and then there is a crisis that seriously threatens
    the security of the country. In the recent crisis, a series of civil
    protests occurred in multiple cities across the country. The protest started
    at a city and quickly spread out to other cities. To prevent this from
    happening again, the government as Plan B -after shutting down the Internet
    across the country-has decided to quickly send his forces to surround the
    city where the protest starts from. A city is surrounded if there are forces
    in each of its neighboring cities. The government has military bases in $b$
    different cities, each having many forces to be sent to al cities. The
    government knows his forces can not pass through the city from which the
    protest starts as they may be killed. Knowing this, it may be a case that
    some cities are not possible to be surrounded by forces. These cities are
    called <em>critical</em>. It is assumed that if there is a military base in
    a city, that city is not critical. Now, the government is eager to know
    whether there are critical cities in the country or not. As a legionnaire
    geek, help the government find his answer.

<p>
    Oh, we forgot to explain the structure of CrisisLand! To resolve this <em>crisis</em>,
    we should mention that CrisisLand consists of $n$ cities numbered from 1 to
    $n$. The cities are connected via $m$ roads which can be used in both
    directions. Two cities are neighbors if there is a road between them. It is
    guaranteed that the road network of CrisisLand is connected.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains three positive integers $n$, $m$, and
    $b$ denoting the number of cities, roads, and military bases, respectively
    ($1 \\le b \\le n \\le 100000, 1 \\le m \\le 200000$). Each of the next $m$ lines
    contains two numbers $v_i$ and $u_i$ denoting a road between cities $v_i$
    and $u_i$. The last line consists of $b$ integers, the cities having a
    military base.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    The output consists of two lines. The first line contains the number of
    critical cities. The second line contains the critical cities in ascending
    order.
