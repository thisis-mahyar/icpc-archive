<!-- Boat -->

<p>
    A river separates Upper Barareh from Lower Barareh. To transport people
    between these two towns, a <strong>two-seater</strong> boat (a boat that can
    carry at most two people) with a certain weight capacity has been provided.
    This boat must be steered by at least one person. i.e. it can not move
    across the river without any passengers.
</p>
<p>
    The National Barareh Festival is scheduled to be held in Upper Barareh. All
    Lower Barareh residents want to participate in this celebration and need to
    move to Upper Barareh as quickly as possible. Your task is to help them move
    to Upper Barareh with the minimum number of boat trips across the river.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $w$, where $n$ is
    the number of Lower Barareh residents ($1 \le n \le 1000$), and $w$ is the
    maximum weight the boat can carry ($1 \le w \le 10 ^ 6$). The next line
    contains $n$ space-separated integers, describing the weights of the
    residents of Lower Barareh. All the weights are positive integers not
    exceeding $10 ^ 6$.
</p>

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    If it is not possible to transfer all the residents of Lower Barareh, print
    a single line containing <code>-1</code> in the output. Otherwise, print the
    minimum number of times the boat must travel between Lower Barareh and Upper
    Barareh (in both directions) in order to transfer all residents of Lower
    Barareh to Upper Barareh.
