<!-- Electromagnetic Attacks -->

<p>
    In Barareh, a Point-to-Point (P2P) wireless network is used to connect base
    stations for private data services. In a P2P wireless network, each base
    station uses some directional antennas to connect with the other base
    stations. If base stations are modeled as points and communication links are
    modeled as line segments, the P2P network in Barareh surprisingly has some
    geometric properties. Specifically, the network is a planar graph whose
    outer boundary is a convex polygon and all interior faces are triangles.

<p>
    In the recent world conflicts, an important question has occupied the mind
    of Khorzukhan, the Minister of Information and Communications Technology
    (ICT) of Barareh. He wants to know how resilient the network is to
    electromagnetic attacks. In an electromagnetic attack, noise is created in a
    certain region (so-called attack region), disrupting all communications
    passing through that region. The remaining network consists of every base
    station and every communication link that were strictly outside the
    attack region. Specifically, Khorzukhan wants to know if the remaining
    network remains connected. To achieve this, he has instructed his ministry
    to simulate multiple electromagnetic attacks separately, testing the
    network's tolerance to interference and reporting whether the remaining
    network stays connected after each simulation.

<!-------------------------------- Input -------------------------------->

<p>
    The first line of input contains $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10 ^ 5, 3
    \\le m \\le 3 . 10 ^ 5, 1 \\le k \\le 10 ^ 5$), which are the number of base
    stations, the number of communication links, and the number of attack
    simulations, respectively.
</p>
<p>
    In the next $n$ lines, the $i ^ {th}$ line contains the $x$ and $y$
    coordinates of the $i ^ {th}$ base station, both of which are non-negative
    integers ($0 \\le x, y \\le 10 ^ 9$). It is guaranteed that not all base
    stations are collinear.
</p>
<p>
    Each of the next $m$ lines represents a communication link. Each line
    contains two integers $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i, j \\le n$), representing a
    communication link as a straight line segment between $i ^ {th}$ and $j ^
    {th}$ base station. The $m$ communication links form a planar graph. The
    outer boundary is a convex polygon and interior faces are all triangles.
</p>
<p>
    At the end, the attack regions come in $k$ lines. Each attack region is a
    non-empty rectangle, represented by the coordinates $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ of
    its lower-left and upper-right corners ($0 \\le x_1 &lt; x_2 \\le 10 ^ 9, 0
    \\le y_1 &lt; y_2 \\le 10 ^ 9$). The sides of all rectangles are parallel to
    the coordinate axes. Note that if a base station or some part (even one
    point)of a link lies inside the attack region (including the boundary), it
    is not usable during the attack.

<!-------------------------------- Output -------------------------------->

<p>
    In $k$ lines, for each attack simulation, print <code>Yes</code> if the
    remaining network resulting from the attack is connected; otherwise print
    <code>No</code>. If all base stations are within the attack region, the
    remaining network becomes empty and is still considered connected.
